# Weekend
- [x] What did you achieve over the weekend?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. Over the weekend I decided on what game I should make and made established a working viewport for the game.
    Glide
        Glide ever downward (until you reach the ground, anyways)
        Avoid enemies and obstacles
        Drop bombs and items
        Get power-ups and ammo
        Use updrafts to fly upward
        Get scored
        Defeat enemies
        Collect coins
        Survive
2. Today I hope to set up the overall structure of the game, and have a very basic working example of gamepley.

# Friday
1. What HTML, CSS, and or JavaScript skills you learned while building your game?
- I learned how to hide and show things with html and css, and really delved into HTML canvas quite a bit. I solidified my understanding of classes and factory functions in JavaScript, as well as timing and program flow concepts.
2. What's one topic you want to spend more practice on?
- CSS has continued to be a rough area for me. I understand the basics just fine, but there have been a lot of random issues that pop out of the blue, which I struggle to overcome.
