1. Over the weekend I decided on what game I should make and made established a working viewport for the game.
    Glide
        Glide ever downward (until you reach the ground, anyways)
        Avoid enemies and obstacles
        Drop bombs and items
        Get power-ups and ammo
        Use updrafts to fly upward
        Get scored
        Defeat enemies
        Collect coins
        Survive
2. Today I hope to set up the overall structure of the game, and have a very basic working example of gamepley.
3. Not at this time.
